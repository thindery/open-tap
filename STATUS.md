# Open-Tap Development Status

## 2026-02-13 — SCOPE REVISION

**Original Plan:** 48-hour hackathon alpha
**Revised Plan:** Proper alpha with audit, tests, docs
**Reason:** Quality over speed for first public release

### Current State
- ✅ Relay server architecture designed (WebSocket, Fly.io)
- ✅ Client connection pattern defined
- 🔲 Server implementation
- 🔲 Security audit (in progress)
- 🔲 Test suite (not started)
- 🔲 Documentation (not started)
- 🔲 Deployment pipeline (not started)

### Revised Alpha Requirements (TBD)
**QA audit in progress...**
**Tech Lead scope revision in progress...**

### Blockers
- None (actively planning)

### Next Actions
1. QA delivers security/reliability audit
2. Tech Lead defines proper alpha scope
3. Revise timeline based on findings
4. Build with tests included

**Previous:** Rush to 48-hour demo
**Current:** Quality-first alpha with proper engineering
**User status:** Cannot test now, wants audit first
